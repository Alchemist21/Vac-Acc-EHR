Lets build a Decentralized Electronic Health Record for Immunization Records.

# Problem Statement
TBD

# Design Statement
How might we improve access for services for students and international travelers so that they have access to paper immunization records by virtue of gaining clearance.

# Goal
Our first iteration will be to create a Personal Health Record (PHR) mobile app that can be used to access a person's paper immunizations records along with providing a doctor's attestation on the Ethereum Blockchain using LinniaJS library.

# Stack (pending)
## Front end
ES6, React, React Native, Redux, Webpack, LinniaJS

## Backend
IPFS, Infura, FHIR standard, 

# Wireframe
